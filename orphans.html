			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>In Wangama Ward, 147 total orphans attend the three schools, posing a challenge for uniform and school fees for these students and the schools. Three students have a disability and are in need of extra support at the schools. All students share textbooks in the classroom; currently 1 textbook for 7 students.</p>
			<p>In order to create opportunities for education for the students, our educational projects include: textbooks, assistance with school and uniform fees for orphans and vulnerable children, and school supplies. With access to the right resources, the students of Wangama can become empowered by their own abilities and gain the confidence to fulfill their potential.</p>
