			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Mdandu is a subvillage of Wangama Village with population 450. It is the farthest subvillage from the center of Wangama. Children from Mdandu make 8 mile round-trip trek to Wangama Primary School Monday-Friday. They typically run and sing together, which is quite uplifting! However, the day-to-day miles these students put in is incredibly exhausting and can take a tole on their bodies and focus.</p>
			<p>The subvillage of Mdandu worked several years to raise funds to build a primary school for the children of Mdandu. Every single household in Mdandu contributed monetarily to the building project. Additionally, builders from the subvillage donate their time and expertise to assist in the actual building process. The goal is to open the school in 2019 for kindergarten-grade 2. Classroom completion for grades 3-7 will commence in 2021. In 2019, Wangama Foundation supplied funds for 20 long benches with desks and desks for teachers.</p>
